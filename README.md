# Welcome to Pok√©Tom!
This is my web UI that interfaces with the PokeAPI Restful API. I have had some previous experience with using Axios and interacting with APIs, and this was a great challenge to refresh my memory!
## To start


### `1) npm i`
To install all needed dependencies!

### `2) npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

## How I worked 

### `Planning`

To begin, I wireframed a quick design using Excalidraw, this is available to see at : . I found this extremely helpful as it let me think about where every component needed to be, and why. Once I was happy with my basic wireframe, I turned to npx create-react-app and got going!

### `Frameworks`

I chose to use React for this project for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I'm a huge fan! 

From a CSS point of view, I decided not to use any frameworks like Bootstrap as I wanted to challenge myself to use my CSS skills, but I can understand why you may use CSS frameworks for different projects!

## Challenges

Before this test, I had no experience using localStorage. 

## Extra Features 

I implemented a dark mode as this is a feature I often find myself using on other sites. 

## If I had more time...
